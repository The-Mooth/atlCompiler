This compiler will use C, byacc (?) and flex to compile ATL (A Teaching Language). 
This is modeled after a compiler I built in college for a class,
which I've decided is in dire need of a rewrite. 
Hopefully, this code will be far more maintainable and elegant than my previous attempt.

NOTE: language documentation, key-variable tree files and some starter code were provided by the professor of my class, Phil Nelson M.D,
who gave verbal permission for the usage of his code in our projects. Some of it is rewritten in this
rendition of the project for my own understanding and preference, but the core concepts remain the same.
If you're curious about specific lines, one giveaway is that my professor uses /**/ for single line comments, while I use //
Thanks professor!
